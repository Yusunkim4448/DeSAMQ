# DeSAMQ

DeSAMQ is a machine learning project that studies model robustness
under input quality degradation using an IQM-based evaluation pipeline.
This project explores extensions to an existing approach by introducing input filtering
and a feedback-driven evaluation component to study model robustness.

## Overview
The work focuses on designing and evaluating an end-to-end ML pipeline, including
data preprocessing, model experimentation, and result analysis.
Experiments were conducted to analyze performance under varying input conditions.

## My Contribution
- Designed the experimental setup and evaluation strategy
- Implemented the end-to-end ML pipeline in Python  
- Analyzed model behavior under degraded or noisy inputs

## Code
The main implementation and experiments are provided in:
- `notebooks/IQM.ipynb`

## Dataset
Due to data size and usage constraints, datasets are not fully included.
Sample data and preprocessing details are described in the notebook.

## Related Work
This project is based on a short research paper exploring extensions to an existing model.

This project was implemented and evaluated using Google Colab.
